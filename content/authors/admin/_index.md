I'm Archana Subramaniyan, a data decipherer, who translates data into actionable insights for business. At present, I am a Women in Data residency fellow working on city of Sacramentoâ€™s crime data to help them make better decisions post-COVID-19. Prior to transitioning to data science, I worked in semiconductor manufacturing (chip) focusing on materials science, pricing and product marketing. In addition, I have 2 years stint as a software programmer.

When I am not doing data science, I enjoy practicing yoga, playing badmiton, hiking, biking and parenting.
